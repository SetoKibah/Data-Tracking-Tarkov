# and then give us a total sum at the end of what was gained or lost.
# Will iron out what specific things we need to track to achieve this.


# What do we want?
#   1- Cost of gearing up
#   2- What was gained as a result of raid
#   3- Cost of re-arming/repairing tools

# Input needed

#       Ammo purchases
#       Armor repair
#       Consumable restock
